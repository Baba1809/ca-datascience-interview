# Data Science Interview

> **NOTE: _Please do not fork this repository_**

For this problem, you are provided a data set recording various details about US domestic flights. The data is for all domestic flights during August in three consecutive years. Please explore the data however you prefer, and try to identify anything interesting, such as correlations, patterns, or interesting outliers. When you are done, prepare a write-up or annotate your notebook to show what you discovered. Be prepared to present your findings to the team if invited to continue to an on-site interview.

This is an open-ended problem, which we expect will take approximately three hours to complete. After investigating the data, don't worry if you don't end up finding particularly "interesting" results. It is more important for us to be able to see how you approach the data and investigate it than taking the time to find the most interesting results.

## Using the provided files

The two starter notebooks, `Starter Notebook (Python 3).ipynb` and `Starter Notebook (R).ipynb`, are Jupyter notebooks containing some starting code that loads the data for you and provides some basic setup. You are welcome to use either of these notebooks as a starting point for your analysis. Feel free to use any additional libraries or outside data that you would like.

If you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) installed, then you can run `jupyter notebook` in this directory to begin working on the notebooks. In order to run the R notebook, you will also need to install the [R kernal for jupyter](https://anaconda.org/r/r-irkernel), which can be installed with `conda install -c r r-irkernel`.

> NOTE: If you have errors with the R notebook, you may also need to run `conda install zeromq`

Also included is `Column_Descriptions.csv`, which explains what each of the columns in the data means.

## Getting the data

If you would like to use something other than the notebooks to work on this problem, you can download the three data files from the following paths:
