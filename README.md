For this problem, you are provided a data set recording various details about US domestic flights. The data is for all domestic flights during August in three consecutive years. Please explore the data however you prefer, and try to identify anything interesting, such as correlations, patterns, or interesting outliers. When you are done, prepare a write-up or annotate your notebook to show what you discovered. Be prepared to present your findings to the team if invited to continue to an on-site interview.

This is an open-ended problem, which we expect will take approximately three hours to complete. This starter notebook will load the airline data into a data frame for you to use, but feel free to use any additional libraries or outside data that you would like. The accompanying "Column_Descriptions.csv" file explains what each of the columns in the data frame means"

## Using these files

The two starter notebooks, `Starter Notebook (Python 3).ipynb` and `Starter Notebook (R).ipynb`, are Jupyter notebooks containing some starting code that loads the data for you. If you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) installed, then you can run `jupyter notebook` in this directory to begin working on the notebooks.

Also included is `Column_Descriptions.csv`, which explains what each of the columns in the data means.

## Getting the data

If you would like to use something other than the notebooks to work on this problem, you can download the three data files from the following paths:
