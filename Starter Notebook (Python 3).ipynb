Please explore the data however you prefer, and try to identify anything interesting, such as correlations, patterns, or strange outliers. When you are done, prepare a write-up or annotate your notebook to show what you discovered. Be prepared to present your findings to the team if invited to continue to an on-site interview.\n",
