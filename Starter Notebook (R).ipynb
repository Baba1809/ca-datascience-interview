Please explore the data however you prefer, and try to identify anything interesting, such as correlations, patterns, or interesting outliers. When you are done, prepare a write-up or annotate your notebook to show what you discovered. Be prepared to present your findings to the team if invited to continue to an on-site interview.\n",

This starter notebook has loaded the airline data into a data frame for you to use, but feel free to use any additional libraries or outside data that you would like. The accompanying \"Column_Descriptions.csv\" file explains what each of the columns in the data frame means."
